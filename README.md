This is a simple project that reads a PDF document stored in the root folder and lets you have a conversation with an AI based on the document’s content.

## How it works:
- The application loads and processes the PDF from the root directory
- It uses Google Gemini LLM to understand the document’s text
- You can ask questions, and the AI responds using only the information in the document

## Tech stack:
- Python
- LangChain
- Gemini API
